Project Documentation
Kenyan Crafts Market – Frontend Online Marketplace
1. Project Overview

Kenyan Crafts Market is a simple frontend online marketplace designed to showcase handmade crafts from Kenya. The website allows users to view products, search for items, and register an account using a frontend-only form. The project demonstrates basic use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while considering privacy and ethical issues in Kenya’s digital environment.

2. Design and Planning

The website was designed with simplicity and usability in mind. A basic wireframe guided the layout, consisting of:

A homepage with a welcome section, featured products, a registration form, and a privacy notice.

A product listing page where users can view and search available crafts.

The design focuses on clarity, easy navigation, and accessibility on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. Technologies Used

HTML: Used to structure the web pages and content.

CSS: Used to style the website, create a clean layout, and ensure responsiveness using media queries.

JavaScript: Used for frontend form validation, simple product search/filter functionality, and a cookie to demonstrate user identification.

4. Functionality

Users can browse products on the homepage and product listing page.

A simple search feature allows users to filter products by name.

The registration form validates user input on the client side before submission.

A basic cookie is set to demonstrate how websites can identify returning users.

5. Privacy and Ethical Considerations

The project includes a privacy notice in line with the Kenya Data Protection Act (2019). Only minimal personal data (name, email, and password) is collected for demonstration purposes. The data is not stored, shared, or processed beyond frontend validation. Users are informed about why their data is collected and how it would be handled in a real system.

6. Testing

The website was tested on different screen sizes to ensure responsiveness. All forms and JavaScript features were tested to confirm they work as expected in a modern web browser.
